# DIY-Wordle
This program is modeled after "Wordle", a popular word game from the NY Times.

When you run the program, instructions on how to play are shown and you are prompted for your first guess.

Each guess must be a valid 5-letter English word, and the program will re-prompt you if you provide an invalid word.

When you guess a valid word, your guess will appear with each letter in a colored box, which represents whether the letter is correct, somewhere else in the word, or not in the word at all.

All of your previous guesses will also appear so that you can use that information to think of your next guess.

A keyboard will also appear in order to show you which letters have not been guessed, or which letters are currently green, yellow, or black.

You will have 6 chances to guess the word, and if you don't get it by the end, the program will reveal the word.
